Dev Test #5
You will be marked primarily on your problem solving approach but cleaner, well indented and beautiful code will be appreciated. Please host your work on Github and share the link with us. 
Create a react component that lists Now Showing movies (refer to BookMyShow’s website) along with a search + typeahead input box that lets a User filter a Movie, Cinema or both. Cinemas here are just category filters for the Movie titles. For example if I type a Cinema named CineMax, then I should see all the movies mapped to CineMax. Another scenario is if I type “Avengers CineMax”, I should see Avengers but it’s state should include CineMax as well. To summarize, you will just list the movie names and the associated Cinemas are meta information tags.

Assume the Movie/Cinema data is available in a JS Object which you can structure the way you like.

You’re free to add any functionality that you think might add value to the search. The aim is for Users to find what they’re looking for easily & fast.

Implementing this using a Flux pattern will be appreciated; but not necessary.

You can get back to us if you have any doubts. 

After it’s done
Push all of this code onto github. Please add adequate comments to explain your approach/logic.
